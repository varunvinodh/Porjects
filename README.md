1.1 MOTIVATION

There were many factors that affected in deciding this dataset, the main reason being I had 3 of the gaming consoles that are listed in this dataset (GBA, PS2 and the PS4). So it. I myself have owned a lot of PS2 games, which intrigued me to check out this dataset.

As I am planning to buy the new upcoming PS5, I wanted to check out this dataset which has the record of most of the games sold worldwide across different regions in different platforms brands like 
Sony Play Station, Microsoft Xbox, Nintendo etc.

 
1.2 PROJECT SCOPE

Most of the Gamers would always have a dilemma while coming to choose the gaming platform for them. It's never been harder to choose the right gaming console. With a portable Nintendo Switch, Microsoft leading the pack on native 4K, and Sony offering the biggest library of games, competition is fierce.

Here I will be comparing the gaming brands with the sales to see which is the dominant while coming to the video games sales Globally. This may help the consumers to make a better decision in making their choice in buying the right console for them.

I have created this project in such a sense that when new data comes along I will still be able to run these codes on the new data which makes this good in the long term.


1.3 PROJECT GOAL 

The main objective of this project is to use the data about all the video game sales and build a predictive Machine learning model to check whether the sale of a video game will be high or not. 
In addition to this we can also use this dataset to check in which region (North America, Europe, Japan) will the sales be high and low.
